## 🧪 Testing & Debug Utilities

This directory contains **temporary testing artifacts** used during local development
and Kubernetes debugging (cookies, request payloads, skaffold experiments).

⚠️ These files are **not part of production deployments**  
✅ They are kept for reproducibility and future debugging sessions
